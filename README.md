## Description 
This application is a simple score tracker for multiple matches, created using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and Vanilla Redux. It allows the user to add new matches, increment or decrement their scores, and reset all scores to zero. Each match has its own state management, ensuring that the scores are updated independently of one another.


## Features

*  Clicking on the "Add Another Match" button will add a new match and the initial state will be 0. Each match will have a delete icon, increment and decrement input fields, and a total score. Each match will have separate state management.

*  Initially, there will be one match with an initial value of 0.

*  Pressing Enter on the keyboard with a value in the Increment and Decrement input field will increase or decrease the match score according to the input field. However, this action will only be performed when the Enter button on the keyboard is pressed.

*  If you want to decrement the score, the total value will never go below zero. For example, if the total value is 10 and you decrement by 15, the total value will be 0.

*  Clicking the Reset button will reset the score of all matches to zero. Note that the total values of all matches will only be reset to zero and will not affect the number of matches created.
